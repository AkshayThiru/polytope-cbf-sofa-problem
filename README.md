# polytope-cbf-sofa-problem
A repository for implementing Polytope-CBF for the sofa problem, which involves moving a sofa through a corridor.

### Dependencies
The following libraries are needed: [MPT3](https://www.mpt3.org/Main/HomePage), and [IPOPT](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt/wiki/MatlabInterface).
A .zip file for IPOPT is included in packages/.
